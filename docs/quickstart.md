# Quickstart

# 1. Creating a population graph

The first step is to create a population graph. In general, we want a realistic population graph generated by JUNE [TODO: tutorial on how to create a world with June]. A small example containing a portion of London can be found in `worlds/data_london.pkl`.

# 2. Running the model

An example of a configuration file can be found in `configs/default.yaml`. The file should be self-explanatory. We can then run TorchJune by simply

```bash
python example_scripts/run_model.py configs/default.yaml
```

# 3. Reading the results

In the default configuration file, the results are saved in `example/results.csv`. This is a csv file containing aggregated data such as number of cases and deaths per date.
